# LED Blinking Patterns

A collection of Arduino LED blinking projects built and tested using **Wokwi**.  
Each project demonstrates a unique LED animation pattern implemented using Arduino code.

---

##  Projects Included

### **1. Knight Rider (Basic Version)**
A sweeping LED effect inspired by the Knight Rider car light.  
Features:
- Sequential LED movement  
- Back-and-forth scanning pattern  
- Simple timing control using `delay()`

### **2. Binary Counter**
Displays values in binary using multiple LEDs.  
Features:
- Bitwise operations (`<<`, `&`)  
- Counting from 0 upwards  
- Visual representation of binary output

##  Tools & Technologies
- Arduino Uno  
- Arduino C/C++  
- Wokwi Simulator
